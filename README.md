# 🏛️ Advanced Crime Examination (ACE)  
📌 **A Comprehensive Crime Investigation Database System**  

## 🚀 Overview  
**Advanced Crime Examination (ACE)** is a robust **database management system** designed for crime investigation agencies.  
It efficiently organizes, stores, and retrieves crucial case-related data, enabling seamless operations for investigative authorities.  

## 📌 Project Motivation  
🔹 The project originated from the challenge of finalizing an idea that was both **impactful and underexplored** in database development.  
🔹 Inspired by real-world **crime investigation agency websites**, particularly **NIA**, we curated an optimal **data model**.  
🔹 The **primary goal** was to design a **highly structured** and **efficient database** that could simulate real investigative workflows.  

## 🏗️ Development Process  
✅ **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram:** A meticulously crafted **ER model** forms the backbone of the system. After multiple iterations and expert consultations, we finalized an optimized schema.  
✅ **Data Insertion Strategy:** Populating tables required careful sequencing due to foreign key constraints, ensuring data consistency.  
✅ **Rigorous Testing:** Iterative refinements were made to enhance data integrity, query performance, and system robustness.  

## 📊 Features  
✔ **Structured Case Management** – Efficiently stores case details, suspects, officers, and legal proceedings.  
✔ **Optimized Query Execution** – Ensures fast retrieval of critical investigation data.  
✔ **Data Consistency & Security** – Implements relational integrity and access control measures.  
✔ **Scalability** – Designed to accommodate expanding datasets and complex queries.  

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **Database System:** PostgreSQL  
- **Schema Design:** ER Modeling, Normalization  
- **Query Language:** SQL  
- **Tools:** pgAdmin4
